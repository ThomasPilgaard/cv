    \section{Resume}
    My name is Thomas, and I am a Consultant at Netcompany A/S.
    I am a very curious person and always interested in learning new technologies. 
    I have experience with Python, \Csh and Bash, and also with Linux and virtualization, Docker and QEMU/KVM, where at home, I run Linux and use a Windows virtual machine to run Visual Studio or some casual games.
    
    I am very flexible, good at teamwork, and not afraid of going the extra mile while working.
    My education is very focused on group work and working together, where each semester, 15 ECTS points is achieved through semester projects, which is made in groups of usually four to seven group members.
    The semester projects are based on problem-based learning (PBL), which is learning through solving problems, where each semester project is build up with the goal of solving a problem.
    
    To give an example of problem-based learning, in our 8\textsuperscript{th} semester project, the synchronization of sound between Android devices was investigated, where we discovered the apps on the Google Play Store, which promised synchronization of sound between Android devices, had very poor quality in regards to keep the sound synchronized. This investigation resulted in the problem that sound synchronization apps on the Play Store did not sufficiently synchronize the sound, and therefore we had to make our own app, which ended up with being better than the alternatives on Google Play Store.

    From my work in Dagli' Brugsen, I have acquired experience working with different people, both regarding customers and colleagues. I worked with all age groups, young and old, where I helped solve the customers problems and strived to achieve that the customer had a good experience.
    I also stayed in China for a year, where I took a Chinese language course at Tianjin University, where I had classmates from all over the world. In that class and from the environment in China, I saw, learned and felt that each culture is different but people can still work together and respect each other.

                                    8\textsuperscript{th} semester  was focused on mobile development where an Android app for synchronizing sound between Android devices was successfully made.
                                    
                                    9\textsuperscript{th} semester, which is the pre-specialization, was about vulnerabilities in Xamarin.Android, where vulnerabilities was found in apps from Google Play.
                                    
                                    10\textsuperscript{th} semester, the Master thesis, is about identifying apps, made with Xamarin.Android, which contains credentials and API keys.} \\

    \section{Interests and Activities}
    One of my greatest interests is computer hardware, where I am particularly interested into gaming hardware and overclocking.
    I also spend a lot of time socializing with my friends, mostly in the Friday bar at the University, or through the various activities made by the F-Klub at the Department of Computer Science.
    I do also enjoy travelling. 
    I have mostly been to Asia, particularly China, and I have also been to several places in Europe.
